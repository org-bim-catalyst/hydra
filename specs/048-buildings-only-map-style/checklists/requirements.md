# Specification Quality Checklist: Buildings-Only Map Style

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-09-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The known "custom styling has no effect on vector base maps" Google Maps constraint is
  captured as an Assumption plus FR-006/User Story 3, worded in user-facing terms
  ("raster vs. vector base-map rendering" as an environment condition) rather than
  naming any SDK/API surface, so it stays implementation-detail-free while still driving
  a concrete, testable requirement.
- All items pass; no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed — the one open technical
  question (vector-map styling limitation) had a clear, defensible default (don't offer
  the option where it would silently no-op) rather than requiring a user decision.
